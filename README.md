PLC Factory is intended to simplify programming PLCs by automatically generating template files. It takes an arbitrary device and template name as input and processes the corresponding sub-tree of devices according to their entries in CCDB.

I developed PLC Factory at ESS under a FOSS license. The code in this repository represents the status quo by the time I left ESS. Since then, the code may have evolved under someone else's authorship.

The original readme file is `README_ESS.md`.
